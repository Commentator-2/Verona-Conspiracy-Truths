<p>Greetings once again to all you believers out there, it’s Peter, here again to bring you the truth of what’s really been going on out there in our beautiful city. Wow, what a week has this been, and so far it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be stopping anytime soon. The Capulets and Montagues have been at it again, and right at the centre of it has been no other than Romeo Montague. That’s right folks, you heard it here first, but as the humble servant of the Nurse of Capulet, I have witnessed Romeo at the events of nearly everything that has happened thus far! Gather round everyone, as I recount the tale of Romeo’s endeavours this past day and a half. 
Harken back your memories to Sunday morning, and the commencement of the dastardly brawl betwixt the Capulets and Montagues early that day. Mere minutes after the fact, I caught word of Benvolio Montague, cousin of Romeo fleeing the scene! Naturally, I knew I had no choice but to follow and see where he would go. It did not take long to discover his location, and I was not surprised to find him at Romeo’s side. Deftly avoiding detection, I crept behind and caught ear of their conversation. As to be expected from the son of the head of the Montague clan, Romeo was busy complaining about his unrequited love. Truly, the benefits of high society had left the young man far more vulnerable than us working commoners, and for a moment I almost felt sorry for him. Curious as to what maiden would reject the opportunity to become a Montague, I listened closer and found my sympathy for Romeo to quickly abate. After a disturbingly long amount of time, Romeo finally noticed Benvolio’s injuries from the battle, and proceeded to truly exhibit his arrogance and insensitivity by comparing the plight of our city to his own failed romance. By his own words, he announced, “tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create!” and continued to list oxymorons for a near eternity. How could he claim to know anything of love, when he believes the great tragedy of a woman not desiring him to be comparable to a “feather of lead,” or to the constant fighting which endangers children in our streets?! And yet, I did find myself agreeing with his general message. As the Prince himself has made clear, we are not going to stand for such treacherous battles in our streets any longer, and the time has come for the two rival houses to put aside their differences and make peace. Realizing this, I made the executive decision to take action. Recalling the guest list I had been given for the Capulet ball, I carefully and unsuspiciously emerged and asked Romeo, whilst pretending to be unaware of his identity, to read it for me. This was in the hopes that he would be able to see the goodness of the house of Capulet, and convince his father to end their feud. After he had finished, I surreptitiously invited him to the party and returned to my hiding spot before they could ask too many questions. Alas, they departed too quickly for me to gain much more information, but I did manage to hear the name of Romeo’s love. What a surprise it was, to hear that the Montague son had fallen for Rosaline, my Master’s niece! Truly, I thought at the time, if they could fall in love, perhaps my plan to bring peace between the families would be successful! Little did I know, what would occur at the party would change everything.
Unfortunately, I was unable to keep eyes on Romeo during the party due to my commitment to other Capulet duties, but what occurred during had the deftest of consequences. Following the ball, I was trimming the hedges around the estate perimeter when I saw Romeo Montague yet again, this time leaping the surrounding walls and racing towards the main building! Naturally I assumed he had hit it off with Rosaline and was going to see her, and in my duty to you all I just had to follow and see how things played out. Imagine my surprise when instead of to Rosaline’s room, Romeo made his way instead to that of Juliet Capulet, Lord Capulet’s daughter! Aghast at what I was witnessing, I watched as Juliet peered off her balcony, and called out to Romeo. In one of the most confusing interactions I’ve ever seen, the two eventually became aware of each other’s presence and proceeded to exchange such delicately crafted prose it would make the head of a bard spin. Unbelievably, Romeo’s affections had jumped from Rosaline to Juliet, over just the course of the ball, and apparently Juliet had responded in kind. Romeo seemed to have a knack for falling in love with the most inconvenient people, and doubt immediately sprang to the front of my mind. If Romeo’s preference could switch so quickly, what was to keep him from breaking Juliet’s heart now that they were in love? After all, they were both young and prone to impulsive decisions, a perfectly fine quality in most teenagers, but for ones with such power and responsibility resting on their shoulders, it may be dangerous to themselves and those around them. In addition, Romeo had been quite depressed following Rosaline’s rejection, and if Juliet realized that she didn’t really love him it could be just as bad or worse than Romeo leaving Juliet for another lady. As there’s no way for them to separate after marriage, either one would only lead to resentment between them, and the formation of even worse decisions for them and the city. As I watched the pair depart, I knew I would have to clarify Romeo’s intentions, and confirm his commitment. I was surprised to learn that my director, the Capulet Nurse, was already aware of the conversation between Romeo and Juliet, and would be meeting Romeo to learn of the time and location for their marriage. I insisted that I be present to see what he would say, and on Monday morning we departed to search for Romeo. 
At approximately noon, we found Romeo with Benvolio and their friend Mercutio. As soon as they saw us, Mercutio, ever the joker, began to berate the Nurse with a folly of comedic insults. Personally, I thought it was quite amusing, but I dared not laugh for fear of losing a limb, and Romeo seemed to follow a similar mentality based from his lack of comment. Nevertheless, Benvolio and Mercutio eventually left and we found ourselves alone with Romeo. Ever the gentleman, he dismissed Mercutio’s comments as idiotic and narcissistic, and attempted to move on with the conversation. After a few more complaints by the Nurse about Mercutio’s comments, we managed to make plans for the wedding. For the sake of privacy, I won’t announce them until after the fact, but it will be very soon and I’ll be there to record what happens. The Nurse seemed convinced that he was committed, but I still reserve my doubts. The respect Romeo showed for the Capulets was promising, and he clearly understands the importance of status in our society, but as to how long things will last before his affections change again or Juliet grows tired, only time will tell. Regardless, there’s no chance of peace if we don’t try, and I remain optimistic that the situation can be kept from getting too out of hand.
Signing off until the story develops, I bid all thee who have read thus far farewell.
