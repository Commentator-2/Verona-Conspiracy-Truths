<h1>Biography</h1>

<p>Sophie Danielpour is a student at Tufts University studying Cognitive and Brain Sciences and Computer Science. Born and raised in New York City, Sophie does not know how to drive a car and has never been to Staten Island, but can direct lost tourists from one end of the island to the other in seconds (or, at least, show them the best local pizza place and call them a taxi). Just having returned from a recent trip to Israel with Tufts Hillel and Shorashim Birthright, Sophie loves to travel and wants to see more of the world and experience other cultures' foods. Having declared her second major as Computer Science while halfway through Mark Sheldon's Data Structures class, Sophie wonders if taking Comp20 and Comp40 concurrently was a good idea. Sophie loves to learn new things and struggle with concepts, so it should all work out. Only time will tell.</p>
