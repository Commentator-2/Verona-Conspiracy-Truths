## What has been implemented:
To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly. All the files used are in the special repo on GitHub, I committed constantly using Git to show updates and changes before pushing changes to GitHub, wrote a README, used at least 5 rules in one CSS file and other CSS files with less than 5 rules, all HTML files pass the validator, all CSS files pass the CSS validator, there are 3 pages with the exact correct file names, and the index.html page hosted on my Tufts CS account (~sdanie05) redirects client to actual website on GitHub.

## Collaborators and discussions:
I completed this assignment without speaking to other students about it, as my friend took the course last semester and showed me her work while she was doing it, and I learned basic HTML and CSS during Polyhack this past October. I did use online resources for help and syntax (such as different valid fonts and colors), however.

## Hours spent on assignment:
6 hours and 15 minutes using the following estimates I tracked while working: 1 hour setting up GitHub (lab 3), 2 hours making baseline html pages and some CSS styling (mostly playing around with it), 30 minutes working on resume page and adding list elements, 45 minutes finishing up resume and adding CSS styling, and 2 hours for biography page and CSS styling and finishing up other stuff (adding links, other CSS changes, validating all the pages).
